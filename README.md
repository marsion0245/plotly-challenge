# plotly-challenge
Bootcamp homework plotly-challenge

The HW was coded and tested on client.
All required functions work.

I tried to published the solution on HEROKO, it crashed during the process.
I had to redo env since HEROKU was crashing due to some Python modules compatibility issues, got help from Tom. 
After that I create another environment and republished the solution.
The evironment started but when accesing app with bowser I got runtime error.
Asked TA for support again (Tom), we could not make it work.
It was quite a waste of time with this one, and it is still not working.
