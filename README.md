# plotly-challenge
Bootcamp homework plotly-challenge

The HW was coded and tested on client.
All required functions work.

I finally published the solution on HEROKO, had to redo env since HEROKU was crashing due to some Python modules compatibility issues. 
After that I create another environment and republished the solution.
The evironment started but when accesing app with bowser I got runtime error.
Asked TA for support (Tom), we could not make it work.
Quite a waste of time with this, and it still not working.
